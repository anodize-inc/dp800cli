# DP800 CLI Configuration File
#
# This is an example configuration file for the dp800cli tool.
# Copy this file to one of the following locations:
#   - .dp800config (in the same directory as dp800cli.py)
#   - ~/.dp800config (in your home directory)
#
# Local directory files take precedence over home directory files.
# Command line arguments always override configuration file settings.

# Set to false to disable color output regardless of terminal capabilities
